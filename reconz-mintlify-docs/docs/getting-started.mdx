# Getting started

This guide walks you through:

1. Creating a ReconZ workspace  
2. Connecting your first chain(s)  
3. Running a basic scan from a transaction hash  
4. Exporting an evidence pack

> This is written for a typical **protocol, exchange, or market maker** integration. If you’re a security researcher or solo analyst, you can follow the same steps.

## 1. Create a workspace

1. Sign in to the ReconZ dashboard.  
2. Create a new **Workspace** for your project (e.g. `Acme Protocol` or `XYZ Exchange`).  
3. Invite teammates with appropriate roles:
   - **Admin** – billing, integrations, workspace configuration  
   - **Analyst** – run scans, view evidence packs  
   - **Viewer** – read-only access to reports

## 2. Connect data sources

At minimum, you’ll configure:

- **Primary chains** (e.g. Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, etc.)
- **RPC / archival endpoints** (your own or third-party)
- Optional: **internal logs** or **SIEM feeds** for extra context

<Callout type="info">
ReconZ is designed to be chain-agnostic and can expand across new networks without rebuilding your workflows.
</Callout>

1. Go to **Settings → Data sources**.  
2. Add your primary chains and endpoints.  
3. Test connectivity to make sure ReconZ can pull historical and real-time data.

## 3. Configure x402 / billing

ReconZ is **x402-native**, so every scan and forensic query is represented as a **pay-per-use transaction**.

You’ll typically choose one of two paths:

- **Direct RCNZ settlement**  
  Fund your workspace with RCNZ. Each scan burns a small amount of token proportional to complexity and data usage.

- **x402 routing (PayAI)**  
  Use your existing x402 merchant / agent configuration to route payments between your agents and ReconZ.

In the dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings → Billing & x402**.  
2. Link your **x402 merchant ID** or **fund RCNZ balance**.  
3. Set **usage limits** and **alert thresholds**.

## 4. Run your first scan

Once your workspace is configured, you can run a basic scan from either:

- A **transaction hash**
- A **wallet address**
- A **set of related transactions**

From the dashboard:

1. Click **New scan**.  
2. Choose the scan type (`Transaction`, `Address`, or `Bulk`).  
3. Paste a tx hash or address.  
4. Select:
   - Chain(s) to trace across  
   - Time window  
   - Scan depth (e.g. number of hops)

Click **Run scan**.

ReconZ will:

- Fetch the relevant on-chain data  
- Simulate potential exploit paths via the **Exploit Detection Engine**  
- Cluster related addresses via the **Forensics Suite**  
- Produce:
  - A **risk score**  
  - **Ranked freeze targets**  
  - A **timeline** of events

See **Guides → Run your first scan** for a more detailed walkthrough.

## 5. Export an evidence pack

Every completed scan can be turned into a **PDF evidence pack** suitable for:

- Exchanges and market makers  
- Internal risk teams  
- Legal / law enforcement

From the scan results:

1. Click **Export evidence pack**.  
2. Choose:
   - Redaction level  
   - Time zone formatting  
   - Optional notes section

ReconZ will generate a PDF containing:

- Executive summary  
- Detailed timeline  
- Address clusters & freeze targets  
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs)  
- Audit log of the scan configuration

## Where to go next

- Learn how ReconZ thinks in **Core concepts → Core intelligence**  
- Follow an end-to-end example in **Guides → Investigate an exploit**  
- Explore integration patterns with x402 in **Guides → PayAI / x402 integration**
