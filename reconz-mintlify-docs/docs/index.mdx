# ReconZ

ReconZ is an **x402-native AI intelligence layer** that automates on-chain investigations and exploit detection across every blockchain network.

Instead of manually stitching together block explorers, chain analytics, and spreadsheets, ReconZ turns raw blockchain activity into **actionable threat intelligence**: ranked freeze targets, exploit timelines, and exportable evidence packs.

## What ReconZ does

ReconZ focuses on three core problems:

- **Early exploit detection**  
  Simulate real attack vectors across multiple chains and detect anomalies *before* they spread.

- **Rapid attribution**  
  Cluster related wallets, follow cross-chain hops, and surface the most likely freeze targets.

- **Evidence packaging**  
  Export a clean, human-readable PDF pack with timelines, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and an audit log of the investigation.

## Core intelligence stack

ReconZ is built around three primary components:

- **Neural Intelligence System**  
  Continuously monitors on-chain activity and flags anomalies correlated with known exploit patterns.

- **Exploit Detection Engine**  
  Simulates attacker behavior across chains, stress tests transaction paths, and scores potential exploits.

- **Forensics Suite**  
  Reconstructs entire exploit flows from a single transaction hash (or set of hashes) and outputs clusters, timelines, and ranked targets.

You can learn more about each subsystem in **Core concepts → Core intelligence**.

## Built on x402 (PayAI)

ReconZ is **x402-native**. That means:

- Every scan and forensic query is treated as a **pay-per-use API transaction**.
- Requests are routed and settled via **x402**, PayAI’s backbone for agent-to-agent payments.
- You can plug ReconZ into your own agents and workflows using the same x402 rails.

See **Guides → PayAI / x402 integration** for integration patterns.

## RCNZ token utility

ReconZ is powered by the **RCNZ** token:

- Each **scan**, **forensic query**, and **data request** in the ReconZ ecosystem *consumes* RCNZ.
- As usage grows, on-chain demand for RCNZ scales with the Web3 security market itself.
- Platforms can integrate ReconZ at the API level and settle usage in RCNZ directly or via x402.

Details live in **Core concepts → RCNZ token**.

## Who is ReconZ for?

- **Founders & protocol teams**  
  Get real-time exploit monitoring and ready-to-send evidence packs for exchanges, market makers, and law enforcement.

- **Exchanges & market makers**  
  Prioritize which addresses to freeze first and justify those actions with transparent, exportable evidence.

- **Security researchers & analysts**  
  Use ReconZ as an “autonomous co-analyst” that handles the repetitive tracing and clustering, while you focus on edge cases and narrative.
