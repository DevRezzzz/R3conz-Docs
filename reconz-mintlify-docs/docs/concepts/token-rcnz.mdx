# RCNZ token

The **RCNZ** token powers usage across the ReconZ ecosystem.

Unlike purely speculative tokens, RCNZ is tied directly to **work done** on-chain:

- **Every scan**
- **Every forensic query**
- **Every enriched data request**

…consumes RCNZ under the hood.

## Utility

RCNZ is used to:

- Pay for **exploit scans** and **forensic investigations**  
- Access higher **rate limits** and **priority processing**  
- Unlock **advanced features** such as:
  - Bulk scanning
  - Historical backfills
  - Custom alert pipelines

## Consumption model

When a workspace runs actions that incur cost:

1. ReconZ calculates the **compute + data** footprint of the job.  
2. The equivalent amount of RCNZ is **charged** to the workspace balance.  
3. A portion of the token used can be:
   - **Burned** (permanently removed from supply), and/or  
   - **Routed** to protocol-owned liquidity / treasury, depending on the final token model.

This creates a feedback loop where:

- More **security demand** → more **RCNZ consumption**  
- More activity on ReconZ → stronger **on-chain usage** data for RCNZ

## Paying via x402

If your stack already uses **x402**:

- ReconZ can appear as a **service endpoint** within your existing payment graph.  
- Your agents can request scans and settle usage in **RCNZ** or **other supported assets**, routed via x402.

## Access tiers (example)

You can expose pricing & limits transparently in your product around tiers like:

- **Sandbox** – low limits, ideal for testing  
- **Operations** – for live protocol / exchange usage  
- **Enterprise** – high-volume, custom SLA, dedicated support

Each tier maps to:

- Monthly or pay-per-use commitments  
- Different RCNZ and/or x402 settlement preferences
