# Core intelligence

ReconZ is built on three core intelligence modules:

- **Neural Intelligence System**
- **Exploit Detection Engine**
- **Forensics Suite**

Together, they form a feedback loop that can both **detect** threats early and **reconstruct** what happened once an exploit is underway.

## Neural Intelligence System

The **Neural Intelligence System** is ReconZ’s always-on anomaly detector.

It:

- Ingests **real-time on-chain activity** across multiple networks  
- Learns patterns of “normal” behavior for:
  - Token flows
  - DEX / CEX activity
  - Bridge usage
- Flags deviations that match known exploit tactics (or novel but suspicious patterns)

Outputs:

- **Signals** that something is off (e.g. sudden burst of small splitter transactions)
- **Context** around the entities involved
- **Priority scores** to help you decide what to investigate first

## Exploit Detection Engine

The **Exploit Detection Engine** is the “attacker simulator”.

Given a starting point (like a tx hash), it:

- Simulates **likely attacker paths** across chains and protocols  
- Scores combinations of hops, swaps, and bridges based on:
  - Known exploit patterns
  - Liquidity and slippage
  - Historical attacker behavior
- Identifies **bottlenecks** and **choke points** where freezing funds is most effective

Outputs:

- **Exploit likelihood score**  
- **Ranked freeze targets** (addresses, contracts, or venues)  
- **What-if scenarios** for different response strategies

## Forensics Suite

The **Forensics Suite** turns raw traces into a **narrative**.

Starting from one or more hashes, it:

- **Traces** funds across multiple chains and services  
- **Clusters** addresses based on shared funding, co-spend patterns, or behavioral fingerprints  
- **Builds timelines** of attacker actions, including:
  - Initial compromise
  - Laundering steps
  - Final cash-out points

Outputs:

- Interactive graph views (inside ReconZ)
- Human-readable **timelines**
- Exportable **PDF evidence packs**

## How they work together

A typical flow:

1. **Neural Intelligence System** flags anomalous activity.  
2. **Exploit Detection Engine** simulates attacker paths and highlights likely exploits.  
3. **Forensics Suite** reconstructs what actually happened and packages the results.

This loop enables:

- **Early detection**, before everything is drained  
- **Rapid attribution**, when you’re under time pressure  
- **Defensible decisions**, backed by transparent evidence
