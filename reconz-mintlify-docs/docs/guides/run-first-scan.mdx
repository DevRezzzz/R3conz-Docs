# Run your first scan

This guide walks you through an end-to-end example:

1. Start from a suspicious transaction hash  
2. Configure a ReconZ scan  
3. Interpret the results  
4. Export an evidence pack

## 1. Choose a starting point

You’ll need at least one of:

- A **transaction hash** you suspect is malicious  
- A **wallet address** associated with suspicious activity  
- A **set of tx hashes** from your own monitoring stack

For this example, we’ll start with a single tx hash on Ethereum.

## 2. Create a new scan

1. Open the ReconZ dashboard.  
2. Click **New scan**.  
3. Select **Transaction** as the scan type.  
4. Paste in the suspicious tx hash.  
5. Choose:
   - **Primary chain:** Ethereum  
   - **Scan depth:** 3–5 hops  
   - **Time window:** last 24–72 hours (depending on context)

Then click **Run scan**.

Behind the scenes, ReconZ will:

- Fetch transaction details and related state  
- Run the **Exploit Detection Engine** to simulate attacker paths  
- Use the **Forensics Suite** to trace flows and cluster addresses

## 3. Interpret the results

When the scan finishes, you’ll see:

- **Risk score** – how likely it is to be an exploit  
- **Key entities** – contracts, addresses, and services involved  
- **Hop graph** – how funds move over time

Pay attention to:

- Sudden fan-out of small transfers to many new wallets  
- Bridging to other chains followed by DEX swaps  
- Interaction with known mixer contracts or high-risk venues

## 4. Ranked freeze targets

In the **Freeze targets** section, ReconZ will surface:

- **Top recommended addresses** (usually centralized choke points)  
- For each target:
  - Rationale (why it’s ranked)  
  - Volume and asset breakdown  
  - Links to raw on-chain data

These are designed to be shared with:

- Exchanges  
- Market makers  
- Custody providers  
- Internal risk teams

## 5. Export an evidence pack

1. Click **Export evidence pack** at the top right of the scan results.  
2. Configure:
   - **Redactions** (if needed)  
   - **Time zone**  
   - **Custom notes** (e.g. internal ticket IDs)

ReconZ will generate a PDF containing:

- Executive summary  
- Full timeline of actions  
- Entity clusters and freeze targets  
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs)  
- Audit log of the scan

You can attach this directly to support tickets, legal requests, or internal incident reports.

## 6. Automate the flow

After you’re comfortable with manual scans, you can:

- Push suspicious hashes from your alerting system into ReconZ  
- Use x402 to let your **own agents** request and pay for scans automatically  
- Configure thresholds so only high-severity alerts are escalated for human review
